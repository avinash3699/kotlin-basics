How to implement multiple interfaces
    * You declare that a class (or interface) implements multiple interfaces by adding each one to the class header, separating each one with a comma.
      Suppose, for example, that you have two interfaces named A and B. You would declare that a class named X implements both interfaces using the code.

        class X: A, B{
        }

    * A class can also inherit from a superclass in addition to implementing one or more interfaces.
      Hereâ€™s how, for example, you specify that class Y implements interface A, and inherits from class C.

        class Y: C(), A{
        }

    * If a class inherits multiple implementations of the same function or property, the class must provide its own implementation,
      or specify which version of the function or property it should use.
      If, for example, the A and B interfaces both include a concrete function named myFunction, and the X class implements both interfaces,
      the X class must provide an implementation of myFunction so that the compiler knows how to handle a call to this function
