Initializing many properties can lead to cumbersome code
    * If you have many properties defined in constructor, your code can quickly become unwieldy.
      Each time you create a new object, you need to specify a value for each of its properties.
    * This may not seem too bad if your data class has a small number of properties,
      but imagine if you needed to specify the values of 10, 20, or even 50 properties each time you needed to create a new object.
      Your code would quickly become much harder to manage.

Default parameter values to the rescue!
    * If your constructor defines many properties, you can simplify calls to it by assigning a default value or expression to one or more property definitions in the constructor.

How to use a constructorâ€™s default values
    1. Passing values in order of declaration
    2. Using named arguments
